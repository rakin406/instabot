# instabot
Instagram chatbot for my personal use.

Requirements:

1. Python-3.7
2. Firefox

Firefox must have logged in Instagram account or else the program won't work.
I could add an option to manually log in to Instagram account but I don't
personally use it as it's slow.

rakin.py is the AI chatbot.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rakin406/instabot.git
cd instabot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```shell
./rakin.py <instagram>
./rakin.py rakin406
```
